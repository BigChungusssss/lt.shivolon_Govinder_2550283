The program found in the getbest directory is called getbest.py. The program getbest.py works as follows:
The program scans through the data file bestdat0.csv, it looks through the columns for your student number and marks, and then scans through those columns to eventually find the student with the higest mark. 
The program then finally prints the student number and the top mark.

In order to run this code go to the main directory Lab2025 using cd ~/Lab2025, then use python3 to run the code, for example python3 getbest/getbest.py test/bestdat0.csv
In order to a unittest on this code, run the command python3 -m unittest test/test_getbest_1.py
